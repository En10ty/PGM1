This assignment will give you practice with functions and vectors. I have given you a starter file called  hurricane.cpp. You are free to create your solution from scratch.  Create a program that will read data from a  file called hurricanes.txt.  The data will consist of a cityâ€™s name, wind velocity and amount of rain for the  hurricanes that occurred in the United States.  The input process will be terminated by the EOF marker. Some  cities will have a space in the name. (use the indata.ignore() statement where needed) Have the main function  call a function to input the data from the file hurricanes.txt and store the data in 3 vectors, City, Wind, and  Rain. The max number of elements is 50. However, the input function will keep track of the number of  hurricanes and put that count in the variable numhurricanes.
